      /* Q1 
          You will ask the user to enter how many courses did he/she finish using the prompt() built-in function 
            (Browser’s method):
              a. The text to be display with the prompt: “How many courses did you finish?”
              b. Add a default value of “0” in case if the use doesn’t input any value
              c. Declare a variable named “numOfCourses” to save the number of courses (which is the value that
                  will be returned from the prompt method based on the user’s input).
              d. The “numOfCourses” should be just an int variable (variable with integer value). Make sure that
                  the input value (which is string) is converted into number (numeric) using any one of the
                  appropriate JavaScript built-in methods/functions
      */
      let numOfCourses = Number(prompt("How many courses did you finish?",0))
      console.log("How many courses did you finish?", numOfCourses, typeof(numOfCourses))
      
      /* Q2
          You will have to check If the user enters an invalid input like a string value instead of numeric as 
            shown in the scenario with images below:
              In the image below, the user made a mistake by typing letter “a” instead of a number
          Then you should do the following two steps:
              a) Use document.write to output the text “Invalid Input!” as shown in the image below
              b) Stop the rest of your code from being executed (you can use if/else condition)
      */
      if (isNaN(numOfCourses)) {
        document.open()
        document.write("<div id='invalid-numOfCourse'>Invalid Input!</div>")
        document.close()
      } else {

        /* Q3 
            Declare an empty array variable named “courseMarks”, this variable will be used to contain the course
              marks (later). This “courseMarks” will be just an empty array object.
        */
        let courseMarks = []
        console.log(courseMarks)

        /* Q4
            You will loop for a specific number of times based on your variable numOfCourses, for example if
              numOfCourses value is 3 as shown in the image above, you will make the loop iterate for 3 times by
              setting its condition. In each iteration of the loop, you will ask the user to enter his/her course
              mark. This mark will be inserted into the array “courseMarks” immediately (instantly on the fly), so
              you will populate this array with the user input through this while loop.
            Notice that You need to modify the course number in the print message for every iteration throughout
              the loop as shown below (Hint: you can user the same while loop counter if it starts with 1):
                - For the first time: Enter your mark for course 1
                - For the second time: Enter your mark for course 2
                - And so on for the x time: Enter your mark for course x
            The “courseMarks” array will be updated inside the loop in each iteration to save the current user
              input which represents the current course mark (with a new index for each mark using the loop
              counter if it counts from 0. or you can just simply use the array method: .push()
        */
        for (let index = 0; index < numOfCourses; index++) {
          let newCourse = Number(prompt(`Enter your mark for course ${index+1}`,0))
          while (isNaN(newCourse)) {
            alert("Invalid Input!")
            newCourse = Number(prompt(`Invalid Input! Enter your mark for course ${index+1}`,0))
          }
          courseMarks.push(newCourse)
        }
        console.log(courseMarks)

        /* Q5
            Now you will need to print or display all the course marks that is saved into the “courseMarks” array
              to the user using any kind of loop. You will print them all with document.write() as shown below or
              in the image in the last page of this document:
                - 98
                - 91
                - 93
