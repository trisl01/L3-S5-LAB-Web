      /* Q1 
          You will ask the user to enter how many courses did he/she finish using the prompt() built-in function 
            (Browser’s method):
              a. The text to be display with the prompt: “How many courses did you finish?”
              b. Add a default value of “0” in case if the use doesn’t input any value
              c. Declare a variable named “numOfCourses” to save the number of courses (which is the value that
                  will be returned from the prompt method based on the user’s input).
              d. The “numOfCourses” should be just an int variable (variable with integer value). Make sure that
                  the input value (which is string) is converted into number (numeric) using any one of the
                  appropriate JavaScript built-in methods/functions
      */
      let numOfCourses = Number(prompt("How many courses did you finish?",0))
      console.log("How many courses did you finish?", numOfCourses, typeof(numOfCourses))
